# TruoraRecipes

Simple web application to display recipes, made as a test to apply to a developer internship @ Truora. The backend is made in Go and the frontend in Vue.js + bootstrap.

This repo contains the backend .exe file for windows testing, but also there is the .go file to build to other platforms.

Note: The deault port for the backend is 8085 and all frontend calls are hardcoded to localhot:8085, so chaning backend port will require some frontend tweaks.
